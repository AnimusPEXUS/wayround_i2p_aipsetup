Hi All

I'm AGUtilities, and I'm trying to build my own GNU/Linux
distribution. And, while moving to my target, I realized that there is
no packaging system suitable to my requirements. So I decided to write
My own. So here it is. I called it `aipsetup'

~

What does it do?

For My own, I needed software to easily build pack install and
uninstall different software packages on system. So, basic properties
of this tools are follow:

1. easy extraction source tarball
2. flexible building system
3. easy and fast pack
4. installing packages
5. uninstalling packages
6. checking installed package integrity
etc

At current time installation and check is not realized at
all. Partially realized removal. Building component realized, but
requires little rules tuning.



Installation.


Download aipsetup(version number).tar.lzma. Extract it. : 

cat file.tar.lzma | lzma -d | tar -x /root/aip

>>> By the way, You need to be a root to use aipsetup

then type: 
#make install 

and, by default, it will be installed to /usr/lib/aipsetup, and
aipsetup front end will be placed to file /usr/bin/aipsetup, and will
be madden executable only by root



Usage.


to extract files from archive:
aipsetup ex file.tar.lzma

to build e.g. tar do:
cd tar<tab>
aipsetup sc usr
bash _tnbuild_usr

to pack it:
cd ../tar-(something)
aipsetup pack

to install pack:
cd ../pack
tar -xf <tab> -jC /

to list already installed files:
aipsetup list | less -S

to remove Slackware or aipsetup package:
aipsetup rm (package file from list .tar.bz2)

search package by file:
aipsetup fn `which soffice`
