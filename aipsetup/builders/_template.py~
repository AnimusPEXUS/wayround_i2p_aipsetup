# Information/Instruction: 

# This is building functionality' package configuration tools, which
# can be called templates.
#
# There can be many different templates which can take information
# from eachother.
#
# This file contains all functions which can be called by other
# templates or some specific aipsetup functionality.
#
# Please keep in mind, what while templates can depend on eachother
# !lookout! and keep away from creating dependency loops.
#
# Basicly, there are some generic templates which usualy needed in
# other templates, so none-generic templates do not need to depend to
# eachother.
#
# REMEMBER! those templates must contain only building staff. NO NEED
# to add here download functionality!!! all final template
# functionality should result in EXTRACTION of source, PATCHING,
# BUILDING and COPYING all needed staff to 04.DESTDIR, and from this
# point, IT'S NOT a template's metter to buildin installation package
# and outputing it to 07.OUTPUT dir.
