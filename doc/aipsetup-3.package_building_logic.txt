Package building logic for aipsetup version 3.x



First of all, we need to determine actions for building and packing
packages. Thous steps must include some before- after- and in-
building time package documenting, so users could determine mechanisms
and ways by which some particular package were build. -- This is a
GNU-Way, thus must be as clear as possible.



Personaly I, tending to copy `builder', `build-info' and `info' files
into building site (here and farther, `building site' term is for
directory containing DIR_* directories listed in build.py). But if I
do so, this can lead to personalityes multiplication and some nasty
mess in outer world, if aipsetup will ever reach some popularity.
